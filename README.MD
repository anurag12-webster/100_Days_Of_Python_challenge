Python 100 Days of Code Challenge
Welcome to my Github repository! Here, I'll be documenting my 100 Days of Code challenge in Python. For the next 100 consecutive days, I'll be tackling a new problem each day by dedicating 20-30 minutes of my time to coding.

In addition to solving coding challenges, I'll also be using this challenge to improve my understanding of Git and Github, and to practice version control system.

Each day, I'll update this repository with my progress and notes. I'm excited to take on this challenge and improve my skills, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
